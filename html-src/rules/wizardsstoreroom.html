<h1>Wizard's Storeroom</h1>
<p>
Hex A Deck type. 1 deck. 1 redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The tableau consists of one reserve stack and five row stacks.
Fourteen cards are dealt to the reserve stack and one card each to the
row stacks.  When a row stack is emptied it must be filled from the reserve
stack first.  When the reserve stack is empty any card can be played on an
empty row stack.  Wizards are wild - any card can be played on them, and they
can be played on any card.  The Wizards have ranks like the suit cards
corresponding to Ace through Four.  If a Wizard is played in it's proper rank
position the row can still be moved, otherwise, the full sequence can't be moved.
The row stacks build down in rank by alternate colors.
<p>
The foundations build up in rank by suit.  The Wizards will not move off of the
tableau until all the other cards have been moved to the foundations.
The game is won when all cards are moved to the foundations.
