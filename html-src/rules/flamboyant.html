Fan game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The tableau piles are built in seventeen sets of three cards, with
two in the back row face-down, and a third face-up card overlapping
them.  The final card is dealt separately.
<p>
The tableau piles are built down by alternate color, with any face-up card
or valid sequence of cards being movable.  Once the top card is moved,
the two below it can be flipped face-up and played.  Empty piles cannot
be filled, except for the final single card, where a king or sequence of
cards starting with a king can be played.
<p>
Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King.  The game is won
when all cards are moved to the foundations.
