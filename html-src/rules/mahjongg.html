<h1>Mahjongg</h1>
Mahjongg tile based solitaire games.

<h3>Object</h3>
Remove all tiles from the tableau.

<h3>Quick description</h3>
Click on two matching tiles to remove them from the tableau.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The tiles are laid out in a particular pattern.  Each Mahjongg game is
played the same, only with a different layout - usually resembling a
figure of some sort, related to the name of the layout.
<p>
The most common layout is the Traditional layout, in which the tiles are
arranged as follows:
<ul>
<li>First, set up the bottom layer of tiles. There are eight rows of tiles,
containing 12, 8, 10, 12, 12, 10, 8, and 12 tiles in them, from top to bottom,
aligned to the center.
<li>Then, a six by six grid of tiles should be placed on top of this layer, in
the center. A four by four layer is placed centered on top of this, and lastly,
a two by two grid is placed on the top.
<li>Finally, a single tile is placed on top. The next two tiles are placed on
the bottom layer, in the middle of the two middle rows of 12 on the left and right
to make points. A second tile is placed to the rightmost of these two files.
</ul>
<p>
Tiles may be removed from the tableau only in matching pairs and only
if both tiles are free.  A tile is free if there are no tiles on top
of it and no tiles either to the right or left of it.
<p>
A set of Mahjongg tiles has three suits of nine tiles plus three Dragons
and four Winds, each of which is repeated four times.  And there four
Seasons and four Flowers.  This makes a total of 144 tiles in a complete
set.  The three suits are usually called Sticks, Coins and Strings although
other names are sometimes used.  A three of Sticks will only match another
three of Sticks.  The Dragons are known by their colors which are usually
red, green and white.  A green Dragon will only match another green Dragon.
The Winds are North, South, East and West.  North will only match North
etc.  Any Flower will match any other Flower and any Season will match
any other Season.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
Remove tiles from the deepest stacks first.

<h3>Notes</h3>
Mahjongg is a game that requires four players referred to as the four
winds.  The first widely distributed computer solitaire game that used
the Mahjongg tiles was called Shanghai and was produced by Activision.
