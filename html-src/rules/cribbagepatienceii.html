<h1>Cribbage Patience II</h1>
<p>
Cribbage type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Deal four cribbage hands to get a total score of 80 points or more.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="cribbagepatience.html">Cribbage Patience</a>,
but two cards are not dealt face-down to the crib.  After moving two
cards from the hand to the crib, a second six-card hand is dealt, and
you move two cards from that hand to finish the crib.  Then, all
three hands are scored.
<p>
Due to the increased number of cards per hand, only four hands are dealt
per game.
