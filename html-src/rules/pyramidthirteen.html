<h1>Pyramid Thirteen</h1>
<p>
Pairing game type. 1 deck. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the single foundation.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="pyramid.html">Pyramid</a>, but all but the
front row of the pyramid are dealt face-down, and no redeals
are allowed.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
This difficult variant of Pyramid is based on the Gnome AisleRiot
rules.  It is called "Thirteen" there, but renamed Pyramid Thirteen
here to avoid confusion with the game
<a href="thirteens.html">Thirteens</a>.
