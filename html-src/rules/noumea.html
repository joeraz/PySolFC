<h1>Noumea</h1>
<p>
One-Deck game type. 1 decks. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The four aces are dealt to the foundations, and 20 cards
are dealt to reserve piles.  The reserve piles can hold a
single card and are automatically filled from the waste or
talon when empty.
<p>
There is no building on the tableau piles, so you can
only move cards to the foundations.
<p>
When there are no moves left, you can deal cards three at
a time from the talon, and move them to an appropriate
foundation.  Two redeals are allowed, so you can go through
the deck three times.  The game is won if all cards are
moved to the foundations.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
<i>Autodrop</i> is disabled for this game.
