Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. 2 redeals.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Quick Description</h3>
<p>
Like <a href="sthelena.html">St. Helena</a>,
but at the start of the game, a card is dealt to each of the
twelve tableau piles.  During this round, an empty tableau pile
will be immediately filled from the talon.  When no moves are left,
the rest of the deck can be dealt.
<p>
Also, there are no restrictions as to which tableau piles
cards can be moved to foundations from, and tableau piles are
built up or down by same suit.
